                <span class="about-span-1">Hello!</span> I am Berkay. In 2018, I took a break from
                my Japanese Language and Literature education
                at <span class="about-span-2">Erciyes University </span>and graduated from the
                Web Design and Coding department at <span class="about-span-2">Anadolu
                    University</span>. Afterwards, I developed myself in the
                software field by taking many online courses.
                Under the Miltek project of the Ministry of Labor
                and Social Security, I received a 100 hour
                <span class="about-span-2">Frontend Developer </span>training from our instructor
                Engin DemiroÄŸ and preapared myself to be
                suitable for the positions in the industry.
